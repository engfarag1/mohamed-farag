  <li>The primary goal of databases</li>
</ul>
There are groups of databases according to the type of mathematical relationship between the data, including:
<ul>
  <li>1-Hierarchical structure</li>
</ul>
It is the adoption of a hierarchical relationship between data elements, so that each element is responsible for only one and not more.
<ul>
  <li>2-Relational structure</li>
</ul>
It is the dependence of a specific relationship between the data elements, so that the value of the element depends on the sum of two elements. This structure is the most successful structure applied in the world of information databases, because of its diversity in the type of relationship between data, because the possibility of implementing relationships in it is greater than any other structure.
<ul>
  <li>3-Structural structure</li>
</ul>
It is the adoption of the relationship of the organizational structure between the data elements, so that two elements are classified under one component or subordinate to it. The term "database" is usually used to refer to both the database and the database management system used to manage it, due to the close relationship between them. The term database is often used outside of a professional IT field to refer to any relevant data set (such as a spreadsheet or index card group), where usage and size requirements usually require the use of this database management system.
