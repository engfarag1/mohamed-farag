  <li>What Is The Database?</li>
</ul>
A database is an organized collection of data, which is generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. When databases are more complex, they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques.
<ul>
  <li>Data Definition - Create, modify and remove definitions that define data organization.
</li>
  <li>Update - enter, modify and delete actual data.
</li>
  <li>Retrieval - Provide information in direct usable form or for further processing by other applications. The retrieved data may be provided primarily on a form as it is stored in the database or in a new form obtained by modifying or combining existing data from the database.
</li>
  <li>Management - User registration and monitoring, data security enforcement, performance monitoring, data integrity maintenance, synchronization control handling, and information retrieval that has been corrupted by some event such as an unexpected system failure.
</li>
</ul>
